# Multi-Agent System (MAS) {#MAS}

> Multiagent systems are those systems that include multiple autonomous entities with either diverging information or diverging interests, or both. [@shoham2008multiagent]

There is no centralized manager controlling all agents.

> A problem needs to be solved in a distributed fashion, either because a central controller is not feasible or because one wants to make good use of the distributed resources. [@shoham2008multiagent]

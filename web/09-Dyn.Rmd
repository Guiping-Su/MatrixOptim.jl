# Dynamic Programming

> Dynamic programming is a useful mathematical technique for making a sequence of interrelated decisions. It provides a systematic procedure for determining the optimal combination of decisions. [@hillier2012introduction]

> Dynamic programming is a general type of approach to problem solving, and the particular equations used must be developed to fit each situation. Therefore, a certain degree of ingenuity and insight into the general structure of dynamic programming problems is required to recognize when and how a problem can be solved by dynamic programming procedures. [@hillier2012introduction]

# Approximation via Relaxation

approximate nonconvex problems with convex relaxations

> Relaxations are superior to general approximations because they provide bounds on true optima. [@taylor2015convex]

> Relaxation techniques complement or supplement branch and bound algorithms of combinatorial optimization; linear programming and Lagrangian relaxations are used to obtain bounds in branch-and-bound algorithms for integer programming.

> Why then is an infeasible relaxed solution better than a locally optimal but feasible solution? The answer is heavily context dependent. [@taylor2015convex]

> They are reliable because they are consistent: whereas locally optimal solutions of nonconvex formulations may depend on an algorithm's starting point, convex relaxations only have global optima. [@taylor2015convex]

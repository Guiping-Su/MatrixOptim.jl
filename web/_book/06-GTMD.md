# Game Theory and Mechanism design



## Mechanism Design

### Desired Properties

According to [@mitridati2019design], following four desired properties are defined:

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:unnamed-chunk-2"><strong>(\#def:unnamed-chunk-2) </strong></span>**Efficiency** The social welfare of the agents participating in the mechanism, with respect to the revealed preferences, is maximized, and no agent desires to deviate unilaterally from its dis- patch. In other words, the outcomes of social welfare maximization align with profit-maximization of agents. </div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:unnamed-chunk-3"><strong>(\#def:unnamed-chunk-3) </strong></span>**Incentive compatibility** Every agent can maximize its utility by acting according to its true preferences. </div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:unnamed-chunk-4"><strong>(\#def:unnamed-chunk-4) </strong></span>**Budget balance (allocation efficiency)** The community manager has neither financial deficit nor financial excess.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

\BeginKnitrBlock{definition}<div class="definition"><span class="definition" id="def:unnamed-chunk-5"><strong>(\#def:unnamed-chunk-5) </strong></span>**Group rationality** No group of agents can benefit by splitting from the community.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{definition}

# Network Optimization

> Applications of the transportation and assignment problems tend to require a very large number of constraints and variables, so a straightforward computer application of the simplex method may require an exorbitant computational effort. Fortunately, a key characteristic of these problems is that most of the aij coefficients in the constraints are zeros, and the relatively few nonzero coefficients appear in a distinctive pattern. As a result, it has been possible to develop special streamlined algorithms that achieve dramatic computational savings by exploiting this special structure of the problem. Therefore, it is important to become sufficiently familiar with these special types of problems that you can recognize them when they arise and apply the proper computational procedure.

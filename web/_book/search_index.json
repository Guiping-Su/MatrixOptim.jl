In other words, the outcomes of social welfare maximization align with profit-maximization of agents. Definition 6.2 Incentive compatibility Every agent can maximize its utility by acting according to its true preferences. Definition 6.3 Budget balance (allocation efficiency) The community manager has neither financial deficit nor financial excess. Definition 6.4 Group rationality No group of agents can benefit by splitting from the community. "]

# Intermediation below Commodity Markets



## Virtual Power Plant (VPP)

> VPP is a cluster of dispersed generating units, flexible loads, and storage systems that are grouped in order to operate as a single entity. [@morales2013integrating]

### Operation of VPP: Profit-Maximization Problem


### Location-Aware Flexibility

> Due to the dispersed nature of these resources, there is only one infrastructure “branched” enough to reach all of them: the distribution grid. Consequently, the management of VPPs will also call, among other things, for: [@morales2013integrating]
> 1. The enhancement of the control and monitoring of the distribution network to guarantee the performance, reliability, and security of the electricity supply.
> 2. The modeling, design and test of advanced components acting actively in the grid such as generators, transformers, smart meters, cables, breakers, insulators, power electronics, and converters.
> 3. The development of procedures to identify weaknesses in the distribution grid and propose guidelines for its reinforcement and expansion.

### Cost Allocation Problem


### Franchise Agreements and Cooperative Games

> Cooperative games are often analyzed through the framework of cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. [@wiki:cooperative]


## Dynamic Pricing and Demand Response

> Each retailer is deemed to have sold to its customers the amount of energy that went through their meters. If for any period the aggregate amount over all its customers exceeds the amount that it has contracted to buy, the retailer has to purchase the difference on the spot market at whatever value the spot price reached for that period. Similarly, if the amount contracted exceeds the amount consumed by its customers, the retailer is deemed to have sold the difference on the spot market. [@kirschen2018fundamentals]

> To reduce its exposure to the risk associated with the unpredictability of the spot market prices, a retailer therefore tries to forecast as accurately as possible the demand of its customers. [@kirschen2018fundamentals]

> The decision on energy consumption is ultimately left to the individual consumers, who must weigh cost savings against a potential loss of comfort. [@morales2013integrating]

### Necessary Infrastructure

> In order to evolve from a setup where supply follows demand to one where demand follows supply, power systems must undergo drastic structural and operational changes. [@morales2013integrating]

### Time-of-Use Tariff

> However, their relevance is challenged as the penetration of renewables into power systems grows sufficiently large to be able to influence prices in the wholesale electricity markets. Time-of-use tariffs are static, i.e., they are fixed long time in advance, and therefore unable to adapt to the rapid fluctuations of renewables. [@morales2013integrating]

### Real-Time Dynamic Pricing

Prices are able to adapt dynamically according to the latest forecast of renewable outputs and consumptions.

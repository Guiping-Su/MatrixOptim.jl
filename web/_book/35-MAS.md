# Multi-Agent System (MAS) {#MAS}

> Multiagent systems are those systems that include multiple autonomous entities with either diverging information or diverging interests, or both. [@shoham2008multiagent]

There is no centralized manager controlling all agents.

> A problem needs to be solved in a distributed fashion, either because a central controller is not feasible or because one wants to make good use of the distributed resources. [@shoham2008multiagent]



## Cooperative MAS {#MAS-Co}

> There are situations where agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. This goal can be viewed as shared between the agents or, alternatively, as the goal of a central designer who is designing the various agents. [@shoham2008multiagent]

### Distributed Constraint Satisfaction

### Distributed Optimization



## Noncooperative MAS {#MAS-Nonco}

> What does it mean to say that agents are self-interested? It does not necessarily mean that they want to cause harm to each other, or even that they care only about themselves. Instead, it means that each agent has his own description of which states of the world he likes—which can include good things happening to other agents—and that he acts in an attempt to bring about these states of the world.

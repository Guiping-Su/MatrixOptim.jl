## Robust Programming

> The seriousness of these unfortunate consequences depends somewhat on whether there is any latitude in the functional constraints in the model. It is useful to make the following distinction between these constraints.  
> - A soft constraint is a constraint that actually can be violated a little bit without very serious complications.  
> - A hard constraint is a constraint that must be satisfied.  
>
> Robust optimization is especially designed for dealing with problems with hard constraints. [@hillier2012introduction]

> The goal of robust optimization is to find a solution for the model that is virtually guaranteed to remain feasible and near optimal for all plausible combinations of the actual values for the parameters. [@hillier2012introduction]

## Dynamic Procurement & Pricing (DPP)

### Demand Response

> Each retailer is deemed to have sold to its customers the amount of energy that went through their meters. If for any period the aggregate amount over all its customers exceeds the amount that it has contracted to buy, the retailer has to purchase the difference on the spot market at whatever value the spot price reached for that period. Similarly, if the amount contracted exceeds the amount consumed by its customers, the retailer is deemed to have sold the difference on the spot market. [@kirschen2018fundamentals]

> To reduce its exposure to the risk associated with the unpredictability of the spot market prices, a retailer therefore tries to forecast as accurately as possible the demand of its customers. [@kirschen2018fundamentals]

> The decision on energy consumption is ultimately left to the individual consumers, who must weigh cost savings against a potential loss of comfort. [@morales2013integrating]

The first thing to know is always how to obtain enough data to construct the problem.

#### Necessary Infrastructure {-}

> In order to evolve from a setup where supply follows demand to one where demand follows supply, power systems must undergo drastic structural and operational changes. [@morales2013integrating]

#### Time-of-Use Tariff {-}

> However, their relevance is challenged as the penetration of renewables into power systems grows sufficiently large to be able to influence prices in the wholesale electricity markets. Time-of-use tariffs are static, i.e., they are fixed long time in advance, and therefore unable to adapt to the rapid fluctuations of renewables. [@morales2013integrating]

#### Real-Time Dynamic Pricing {-}

Prices are able to adapt dynamically according to the latest forecast of renewable outputs and consumptions.

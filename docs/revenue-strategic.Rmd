> The zero-sum nature of pricing makes this inevitable. Firms are constantly improving their pricing strategies to collect as much revenue as possible, and customers are constantly modifying their purchase plans to pay as little as possible. [@su2007intertempora]

> When study the optimal pricing of a finite quantity of a fashion-like seasonal good in the presence of forward-looking (strategic) customers. We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior.

# optim_matrix
MILP, Robust Optim. and Stochastic Optim. with Decomposition Algorithm in Julia

In this package, there are formulation algorithm for three kinds of optimization problems, and two decomposition
algorithms for faster MILP solving.

Three kinds of optimization problems are:  
- Mixed Integer Linear Programming
- Robust Optimization
- Stochastic Optimization

Two decomposition algorithms are:
- Benders Decomposition
- Dantzig-Wolfe Family Decomposition

# MatrixOptim 矩阵优化

MILP, Robust Optim. and Stochastic Optim., and Decomposition Algorithm in Matrix (by Julia)

通过矩阵表示混合整数线性规划，鲁棒（抗差）优化，随机优化和分解算法（使用 Julia 语言）。中文详解请见[wiki/9-zh](https://github.com/edxu96/MatrixOptim/wiki/9-zh)。

Every optimization problem can be written in matrix form. For some problems, it may seems trivial, but it's coherent and easy to understand. Secondly, when it comes to specific solving algorithms, it's more general in matrix form. Thirdly, the abstraction algorithm for problem modeling helps a lot in understanding.

## 1,  What? and Why?

The MILP can be formulated in the following matrixes:

```
min  vecFf * vecXx + vecGg * vecYy
s.t. matAa1 * vecXx + matCc1 * vecYy <= vecBb1'
     matAa2 * vecXx + matCc2 * vecYy <= vecBb2'
     vecXx in R
     vecYy in Z+
```

There are two directions for matrix optimization to develop: make modeling easier and solving faster.

### 1.1,  Specialization

In this package, there are formulation algorithm for three kinds of optimization problems, and two decomposition
algorithms for faster MILP solving.

- Stochastic Optimization: [edxu96/StochasticOptim](https://github.com/edxu96/StochasticOptim)

### 1.2,  Decomposition

Two decomposition algorithms are:
- Benders Decomposition
- Dantzig-Wolfe Family Decomposition
